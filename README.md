### Automated Test

To run the test you need to cd into the tic-tac-toe diretory and run:

```rspec spec/```

## Game Rules

1. The game is played on a grid that's 3 squares by 3 squares.
```
           1 | 2 | 3
	   - + - + -
	   4 | 5 | 6
	   - + - + -
	   7 | 8 | 9

```

2. Player 1 will be X and Player 2 will be O; Players take turns placing their marks in empty squares.

```
Your turn
           X | 2 | 3
	   - + - + -
	   4 | 5 | 6
	   - + - + -
	   7 | 8 | 9

Your friends' turn

           X | 2 | 3
	   - + - + -
	   4 | O | 6
	   - + - + -
	   7 | 8 | 9

```

3. The first player to get 3 of her marks in a row (up, down, across, or diagonally) is the winner.

```
Winning combinations (W is equal to X or O)

   W | W | W       1 | 2 | 3	   1 | 2 | 3       W | 2 | 3       1 | W | 3	   1 | 2 | W       W | 2 | 3	   1 | 2 | W
   - + - + -	   - + - + -	   - + - + -	   - + - + -	   - + - + -	   - + - + -	   - + - + -	   - + - + -
   4 | 5 | 6	   W | W | W	   4 | 5 | 6	   W | 5 | 6	   4 | W | 6	   4 | 5 | W	   4 | W | 6	   4 | W | 6
   - + - + -	   - + - + -	   - + - + -	   - + - + -	   - + - + -	   - + - + -	   - + - + -	   - + - + -
   7 | 8 | 9	   7 | 8 | 9	   W | W | W	   W | 8 | 9	   7 | W | 9	   7 | 8 | W	   7 | 8 | W	   W | 8 | 9

```

4. When all 9 squares are full, the game is over. If no player has 3 marks in a row, the game ends and nobody wins

```
for example: nobody wins

           X | X | O
	   - + - + -
	   O | O | X
	   - + - + -
	   X | O | O

```
