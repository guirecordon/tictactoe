## Tic Tac Toe Rules

1. The game is played on a grid that's 3 squares by 3 squares.
```
           1 | 2 | 3
	   - - - - -
	   4 | 5 | 6
	   - - - - -
	   7 | 8 | 9

```

2. Player 1 will be 'X' and Player 2 will be 'O'; Players take turns placing their marks in empty squares.

```
Your turn
           X | 2 | 3
	   - - - - -
	   4 | 5 | 6
	   - - - - -
	   7 | 8 | 9

Your friend's turn

           X | 2 | 3
	   - - - - -
	   4 | O | 6
	   - - - - -
	   7 | 8 | 9

```

3. The first player to get 3 of his marks in a row (horizontally, vertically or diagonally) is the winner.

```
Winning combinations (Examples for Player 1)

   X | X | X       1 | 2 | 3	   1 | 2 | 3       X | 2 | 3       1 | X | 3	   1 | 2 | X       X | 2 | 3	   1 | 2 | X
   - - - - -	   - - - - -	   - - - - -	   - - - - -	   - - - - -	   - - - - -	   - - - - -	   - - - - -
   4 | 5 | 6	   X | X | X	   4 | 5 | 6	   X | 5 | 6	   4 | X | 6	   4 | 5 | X	   4 | X | 6	   4 | X | 6
   - - - - -	   - - - - -	   - - - - -	   - - - - -	   - - - - -	   - - - - -	   - - - - -	   - - - - -
   7 | 8 | 9	   7 | 8 | 9	   X | X | X	   X | 8 | 9	   7 | X | 9	   7 | 8 | X	   7 | 8 | X	   X | 8 | 9

```

4. When all 9 squares are full,it's a tie and the game is over.

```
Tie example: nobody wins.

           X | X | O
	   - - - - -
	   O | O | X
	   - - - - -
	   X | O | O

```

5. If a player takes a number not in range between 1 and 9 or an already taken number he will get an error, and will get prompted to choose another number.

6. Have fun!
